            <h1 id="heading2">About the Legend</h1>
            <p>
                ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
                <br><br>
                ☛ He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958
                joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
                <br><br>
                ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the
                SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>“Missile Man.”</strong>
                <br><br>
                ☛ Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated
                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
                <br><br>
                ☛ He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
                tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                <br><br>
                ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
                principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                <br><br>
                ☛ His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and
                established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
                community.
                <br><br>
                ☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a
                road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan
                called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a
                vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Kalam received <strong>7</strong> honorary doctorates from <strong>40</strong> universities. The
                Government of India honoured him with the <strong>Padma Bhushan in 1981</strong> and the <strong>Padma
                    Vibhushan in 1990</strong> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to
                the Government.
                <br><br>
                ☛ In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the
                scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.
                <br><br>
                ☛ In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize
                excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".
                <br><br>
                ☛ While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                from an apparent cardiac arrest on <strong>27 July 2015</strong>, aged 83.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <strong>Kalam Island</strong> in
                September 2015.
                <br><br>
                ☛ A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <strong>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam
                    Road</strong> in August 2015.
                <br><br>
                ☛ In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as
                Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.
